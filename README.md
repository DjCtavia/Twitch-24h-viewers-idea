# Realization of a game in 24 hours on Twitch based on people's ideas

## The choice of ideas

For one afternoon, I made a simple thought, what if for once I tried to make a game based on people's ideas? All in 2D to make my job easier!

And from there, with the few people following me on twitter, ideas appeared.

- A monkey
- Bomberman style
- Platform game

And my personal touch:

- Multiplayer

For the sake of consistency and dynamism of the gameplay, I preferred to exclude the platform game. But from then on, I had all the ideas together!

## The choice of programming language

From now on, all I had to do was learn a game engine, which I had never used before (to spice it up). Several programming languages available:

- GDScript (Specific to the game engine)
- VisualScript
- .NET / C#
- GDNative / C+++

In the 4 choices I wanted to move forward on the GDScript that was specific to the game engine, which looks a lot like python and a dubious mix of C# (to my taste).

I have a solid foundation in C, but in C# and C++, let's say I only know the foundation. So to work more "efficiently" I wanted to test the language integrated into the engine.

From now on, it was more or less like learning a new "lib", 1 week before doing the 24h I looked at it 3 days in the week, 2 days to test features like animation and implementation of a basic UI, and 1 full day to make a simple server with a chat. (It is not included in this project)

I was very septic about the multiplayer part the day before, because I had only done a rudiment of "high level" networking available on the official documentation, I had not touched on other methods available to further expand its use.

But on D-Day, the creation of the lobby went successfully, on the other hand, the second "High level" part of the networking was not really understood, half of the live was to try to understand how it works. (And over the last 4-5 hours, I finally understood, but very exhausted to do more code that I found too verbose)
